Put all the python file in one folder and the script will download the data if it is not available.

#To run ANN with 2 class built from scratch run the below command
python Train_2_class.py

#To run ANN with 5 class built from scratch run the below command
python Train_5_class.py

#To run ANN built with CNN and pytorch library for 2 classes:
open the folder in jupyter notebook or lab and run each cell
of file Cifar_2_class.ipynb

#To run ANN built with CNN and pytorch library for 5 classes:
open the folder in jupyter notebook or lab and run each cell
of file Cifar_5_class.ipynb

#The png file conatins the training loss and validation loss graph:
